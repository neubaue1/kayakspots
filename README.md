Homework 4 for UPP 465: This webpage shows spots Allison has kayaked near Chicago so far this summer.

This webpage shows spots Allison has kayaked near Chicago so far this summer via an online map with kayak launch sites and paddle trails/path. Each point, line, and polygon feature has a popup with more information.
The webmap index and css codes were modelled after an in-class demonstration provided by instructor Shelley Hoover, and created using sublime text. The web map was developed using a leaflet basemap and manually adding features using leaflet methods and inputting lat/long coordinates derived from google maps.
The geographic extent of the web map is the Chicagoland area, since that is where I have mainly ventured out with my kayak so far this summer. The purpose of this project is to test out coding for creating and styling a webpage and developing an online map with JavaScript.
